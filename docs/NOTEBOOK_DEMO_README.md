## 📊 How to Use the Notebooks

### Step 1: Run All Cells
- Execute all cells in sequence to see the complete demonstration
- Each cell builds upon the previous ones

### Step 2: Understand the Flow
1. **Data Loading**: Input datasets are loaded and analyzed
2. **Relationship Analysis**: Foreign key relationships are validated
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Data distributions and patterns are examined
4. **Synthetic Data Loading**: Generated synthetic data is loaded
5. **Quality Validation**: Referential integrity is checked
6. **Comparison**: Input vs synthetic data is compared
7. **Visualization**: Results are displayed in charts and graphs

### Step 3: Interpret Results
- **Green Checkmarks (✅)**: Indicate successful validation
- **Warning Signs (⚠️)**: Indicate areas needing attention
- **Percentage Scores**: Show quality metrics (95%+ is excellent)

## 📈 Key Metrics to Look For

### Referential Integrity
- **Target**: 95%+ integrity score
- **What it means**: Foreign key relationships are properly maintained

### Data Quality
- **Missing Values**: Should be minimal or zero
- **Duplicate Rows**: Should be minimal
- **Data Types**: Should match between input and synthetic

### Statistical Similarity
- **Distributions**: Should be similar between input and synthetic
- **Patterns**: User engagement patterns should be preserved
- **Relationships**: Table relationships should be maintained

## 🎯 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: HR Data Demo
**Use Case**: Show how the platform handles complex enterprise HR data
**Key Points**:
- Multiple related tables with intricate relationships
- Employee-department-position hierarchies
- Salary and performance data
- Training and skill management

### Scenario 2: Social Media Demo
**Use Case**: Show how the platform handles simpler but high-volume social data
**Key Points**:
- User-post relationships
- Engagement patterns
- Content distribution
- User activity levels

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Datasets
